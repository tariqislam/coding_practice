Strategy pattern:
This defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating them, and making them interchangeable (at runtime).
It allows the client who uses the algorithm to vary from the algorithm itself.

Method:
Separate the code that changes from the code that remains the same.
Create an interface for that code/behavior/algorithm.
From your objects that have that behavior, program to the interface and not the concrete class/method.

Design principles:
1. Identify aspects of application that vary, then separate them from ones that stay the same.
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
3. Favor composition over inheritance.
